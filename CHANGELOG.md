## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-26

### Changed

- Lifted surface and line contrast tokens (`--bg-2/3`, `--surface`, `--surface-2`, `--line/-2/-3`) so table dividers, code-block frames, and inline-code chips read as real edges instead of dissolving into the page.
- Rebuilt the Six Pillars illustrations on the landing page to match the design bundle:
  - CRUD: SVG converging dashed lines from a 10-model grid into the polymorphic-tools hub.
  - Prompt Strategies: added the `validateSection` section-progress panel with ok/warn/todo marks and per-strategy op chips.
  - Interactive MCP Apps: replaced the stub form with the full Claude-desktop chat (user bubble, gradient `k` avatar, assistant text, embedded `Create book` form with Save/Cancel, "rendered by ui://book/create" footnote).
  - Analysis Memories: added the `analysis_ingest` progress card (12,847 records, gradient bar) and the cross-boundary note; right column gained the `analysis_query` cluster bars with TTL/shown legend.
  - Domain Intelligence: wrapped the workflow in a labelled card, added the `check_business_rules` panel (one failing rule highlighted) and the `get_domain_context` knowledge card with "#billing/#identity/#workspaces" tags.
  - OAuth 2.1 + PKCE: added the per-step note, the `introspect` badge with `RFC 7662 · 8707` tag, and the full RFC ribbon (CIMD draft, OIDC Core 1.0 included).
